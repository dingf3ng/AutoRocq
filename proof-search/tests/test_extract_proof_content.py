"""
extract_essential_proof_content: the context trimmer that decides what the LLM
gets to see of a Why3-generated goal file.

The fallback is pure text processing, while the runtime path uses CoqPyt's
parsed context to distinguish global references from binders and declaration
names. The old tests stood up a whole ContextManager and collected checks into
a returned boolean that pytest ignored, so every check could fail while the
test still passed.
